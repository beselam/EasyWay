# EasyWay
### Idea and description

The idea is to create a React-Native application that can be used to car rental/subscribe service. User can browse different cars and rent them to users personal use. User can subscribe to one or multiple cars at the same time. The subscription time can be changed and also user can add additional accessories with the car for example bike rack.
